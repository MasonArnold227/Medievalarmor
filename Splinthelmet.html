      <h1>Splint armor and Helmets</h1>
      <section>
        <p>Splint armor and helmets are probably the most important of armors. Splint armor blocks your arms and legs, and helmets block your head. It's pretty self explanatory why you need to protect your head when someone is swinging a bladed or
          blunt
          weapon at it.</p>

        <h2>Barbute</h2>
        <img src="Barbute2.jpg" alt="Barbute Helmet">
        <p>This is a barbute. It's a fairly protective helmet considering the giant opening. The main feature of this helmet is that it's one of the earliest helmets to use a curved top to keep your head from being cut.</p>

        <h2>Sallet</h2>
        <img src="Sallet2.jpg" alt="Sallet Helmet">
        <p>This is a sallet. A sallet helmet is very protective, especially with a bevor. A sallet has a curve on the back. It is the successor to the bascinet in Italy</p>

        <h2>Bascinet</h2>
        <img src="Bascinet2.jpg" alt="A bascinet helmet">
        <p>The bascinet was used for a fairly long time. It was later in the middle ages, and provided a lot of protection and had a curved head like the barbute, but even more curved. It is also one of the earliest helmets that had a visor, which
          was added around the mid
          1300's A.D.</p>

        <h2>Great Helm</h2>
        <img src="Greathelm.png" alt="Great helm">
        <p>The great helm is a very very old helmet. Used from 1220 to 1350 A.D, this helmet lacked a curved top, so it was easy to cut through. It was a building block in the improvement of European helmets.</p>

        <h2>Arm Pieces</h2>
        <img src="Vambrace.jpg" alt="A vambrace">
        <p>The vambrace is the main arm protection throughout most of the Medieval times.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Full Arm Guard</h2>
        <img src="Armguard.jpg" alt="An entire arm guard.">
        <p>This is a combination of a vambrace, pauldron, couter, and a rerebrace. It was the main protection used for the entire arm when people still wore plate armor. </p>
