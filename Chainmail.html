    <h1>Chainmail Armor</h1>
    <p>Contrary to plate armor, chainmail is used when you need armor that’s lighter than plate armor. Though not nearly as comfortable as plate armor, it was still lighter. Plate armor was strapped to your body, chainmail is more of a long shirt, it
      rested on you in a very uncomfortable manner. It stil allowed for mobility and protection against whatever they are going against.
      The mobility helped at the cost of protection. It didn’t provide good protection from blades or blunt weapons, but was still necessary for protection in a time of war.

    <p>A chain mail shirt. Longer than the plate armor, but it's not very comfortable compared to full plate armor, but it's a lot more mobile. Plate armor being strapped to you is still a lot heavier.</p>

" alt="Chainmail mask.">
    <p>This is a chainmail mask. It provides protection for the face, unlike the shirt, and is usually used in combination with other armors rather than being on its own. There's a lot of different combinations people used in history with the
      chainmail mask that not only looked good, but also were really protective.</p>
